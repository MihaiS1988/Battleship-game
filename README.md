# Battleship-game
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Battleship in Python. In this game, the player must try to guess the location of a hidden battleship on a 5x5 grid.

## Installation
To play the game, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer.

## How to play

* Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the battleship.py file is located.
* Run the battleship.py file by typing python battleship.py and pressing enter.
* The game will start and you'll see the game board, represented by a 5x5 grid of "O" characters. The battleship is hidden somewhere on the board.
* You have four turns to try to guess the location of the battleship. On each turn, you'll be prompted to enter a row and column number to guess.
* If you guess the correct location of the battleship, you win the game! If you don't guess correctly within four turns, the game is over.
* After each guess, the game board will be updated to show your guesses. "X" characters represent missed guesses, and the battleship location will be revealed when the game is over.
